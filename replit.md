# GEM-T Chat Application - Architecture Guide

## Overview

GEM-T is a healthcare information chatbot application designed to provide information about transgender healthcare services in Brazil's public health system (SUS). The application is built as a full-stack web application with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend, featuring a conversational AI interface that helps users navigate complex healthcare processes.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monolithic architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend components:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for bundling, TailwindCSS for styling
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, serving both API endpoints and static files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- **Development Environment**: Configured for Replit with hot reload and automatic deployments

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture

**React Application Structure**:

- Built with React 18 and TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Custom hooks for state management and API interactions

**UI Framework**:

- Shadcn/ui component library for consistent design system
- Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- Responsive design supporting mobile and desktop interfaces

**State Management**:

- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- Local React state for UI interactions
- Custom hooks for chat functionality and mobile detection

### Backend Architecture

**Express.js Server**:

- TypeScript-based Express application
- Middleware for request logging, JSON parsing, and error handling
- Separation of concerns with dedicated routes, services, and storage layers

**API Design**:

- RESTful endpoints for chat interactions and message retrieval
- Structured error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Input validation using Zod schemas

**Service Layer**:

- Document processing service for handling healthcare information
- Natural language processing service for generating contextual responses
- Modular design allowing for easy extension and testing

### Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User submits a query through the chat interface
2. **Frontend Processing**: React components handle UI updates and loading states
3. **API Request**: Frontend sends POST request to `/api/chat` endpoint
4. **Backend Processing**:
   - Server validates input and stores user message
   - NLP service analyzes query and searches document corpus
   - System generates contextual response with source citations
   - Assistant message is stored in database
5. **Response Delivery**: Both user and assistant messages returned to frontend
6. **UI Update**: Chat interface updates with new messages and typing indicators

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

**Development Environment**:

- Replit-optimized configuration with automatic environment setup
- Hot module replacement for rapid development
- PostgreSQL database automatically provisioned

**Production Build**:

- Vite builds optimized frontend bundle to `dist/public`
- esbuild compiles backend TypeScript to `dist/index.js`
- Single deployment artifact serving both frontend and API

**Environment Configuration**:

- Database URL configured via environment variables
- Automatic port binding and health checks
- Scalable deployment target configured for production
